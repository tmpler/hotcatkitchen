     <h1>About</h1>
           <hr>
           <p>I’m passionate about food – keeping it as nature intended - I aim to create recipes with ingredients that flow together.</p>
           
           <p>Every so often (a little less now than I would like to) I travel to Southern Italy to our family holiday home in Brancaleone (lions’ paw) which is a small town on the Marina - an hour or so drive from the main town of Reggio Calabria.</p>
           
           <p>My Dad is from Calabria which is where the connection is from.   I have many wonderful memories which stem back to when I was young – every year we would travel by car and holiday there, the journeys are another story!  
Sometimes I would take a friend to the unassuming heat of the Calabrian Italian sun. The sea being the main attraction there, with glistening salty clear water, which would dry and leave a pretty pattern on your skin as you sunbathed. Like the Italians we would leave the beach at midday before the mad dogs turned crazy. You know when it’s time to leave for lunch as apart from the people mass vacating you can smell the vapour of tomato sauce and pasta and meatballs cascading out of the nearby windows. After you haul yourself back in to the house with sandy feet and just enough energy to pull yourself into the shower you know the reward will be imminent as it is time to eat.</p>
           
           <p>If there is one thing that makes Calabrian food Calabrian, it is spicy red peppers, and oh yes they are hot.  And they're in everything: the salami, the sausage, the vegetables, the pasta, the fritters. They make a starring appearance in the Calabrian pork paté called 'nduja(pronounced in-DOO-ya), which in some versions is like a coarse meat paste with peppers.</p>
           
           <p>My first taste of chilli salsa came from my sister Claudia – she would painstakingly chop fresh chillies into tiny pieces, dry them in the sun and add her secret herbs and spices to them to make her authentic sauce. My family and I would visit her at her place in Palizzi - eat like kings from her table – all harvested by hand including fish, rabbit and tomatoes, but the food was never not accompanied by a little jar of salsa…..    Each year she would give us a parting gift of her delicious and addictive sauce.  Until one year – she said – “I’m not making it anymore!”  It was like a bullet to my head! What could I do? I just had to make it myself!</p>
           
           <p>Now you know  why I had to create my salsa – I’m somewhat addicted, as is my family – so when the food is just asking for that little kick I just reach for my HOT CAT chilli salsa – if you’re like me you will always have a jar of it in the cupboard somewhere.</p>
